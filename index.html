       <p>My professional life in IT began 10 years ago in July 2007 when I was hired for a summer job as a PC Technician at Circuit City. I worked there for a few months before going over to Best Buy again for another few months. I then took a break for school and then worked at Radio Shack in technology sales for the summer of 2008. I took another one year break for school and then returned to Radio Shack for another 8 months.</p> 
       <p>My first office IT job was as a student IT Worker at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine where I assisted staff members with their IT needs. I worked there for one semester. I then took a break to finish my Associate's Degree and to volunteer in the church. I tried to find more IT work in the New Orleans area but was unsuccessful. In the summer of 2012, I came to St. Louis where my brother lived to finish my Bachelor's Degree at UMSL and occassionally help him with this business.</p>
       <p>While completing my degree at UMSL, I have worked for 2 Managed Services Provider (MSPs, IT providers for small to medium sized businesses), briefly for St. Louis County IT (until I broke my leg in an accident), a law firm, and finally (and presently) at Scottrade. I began at Scottrade by interning on the Workstation Technician team and then full-time now on the Service Desk.</p>
       <p>I first heard of Launchcode while completing my degree in Information Systems at UMSL. The department advertised the LC101 class at UMSL but I was unable to enroll at the time due to a class conflict. Upon graduation, I had interviewed for a Junior Software Engineering position at Express Scripts that I thought I had done very well on, only to be told that they decided to move on with other candidates since I did not have the right skill set for the position. It hurt. It was a punch in the gut. So this motivated me to enroll in this program. Additionally, I do not want to end user support any longer, and this gives me an avenue out of that.</p>
       <p class="redtext">As a coder, I am interested in developing web applications and to go as far as my skills will take me. I love to learn and will continue to learn!</p>
